Welcome to the Tregony Repair Caf√© - a place where community and sustainability meet. We believe in repairing and reusing items, sharing skills, and reducing waste.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to bring the local community together to repair broken items, share knowledge, and help each other. By doing so, we aim to reduce waste and promote sustainability.

## What We Do

- **Repair Sessions**: Every fourth Saturday of the month, we invite you to bring your broken items for repair. Our team of volunteers will do their best to fix them.
- **Skill Sharing**: Learn new skills or share your own. We welcome everyone, from experienced repairers to beginners.
- **Community Building**: Enjoy a cup of tea or coffee, meet your neighbors, and be part of our friendly community.
