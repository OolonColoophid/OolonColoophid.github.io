Our November repair café, held on the 23rd at the Village Hall, marked our final gathering of 2024. What a great way to close out the year! The atmosphere was festive, with our [Toy Swap](https://www.tregonyrepaircafe.org/repair-cafe/community/sustainability/2024/10/27/unscary-repairs.html) table adding extra cheer to our usual repair activities. From cherished teddy bears to practical household items, our volunteers were busy breathing new life into beloved possessions.

## Looking Back on 2024

Since our launch in February, the Tregony Repair Café has made a significant impact on our community. Throughout the year, we've:

- Hosted 10 successful repair cafés
- Welcomed over 200 items for repair
- Achieved a success rate of approximately 80% for repairs attempted
- Saved numerous items from landfill, from vintage record players to modern electronics
- Built a strong volunteer base of skilled repairers and support volunteers
- Created a welcoming community space where skills are shared and stories are exchanged
- Served countless cups of tea and coffee, sometimes with biscuits and cake!

Notable repairs throughout the year included our heaviest item (a tumble dryer in March), our oldest item (a 1947 teddy bear in November), and countless everyday items that might otherwise have been discarded.

We look forward to reopening our doors February 1st 2025 (1 - 3pm), continuing our mission of reducing waste, sharing skills, and strengthening community bonds. Whether you have something that needs fixing or just want to join us for a cup of tea and a chat, you'll always find a warm welcome at the Tregony Repair Café.

_Mark your calendars: Our first repair café of 2025 will be held on Saturday, February 1st, from 1-3pm at Tregony Village Hall._
