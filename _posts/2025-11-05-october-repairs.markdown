Our October 25th repair café saw successful repairs and positive visitor feedback. From trousers altered for a wedding to computers upgraded for personal and community use, the day demonstrated what we do: keeping items in use and building community connections.

## Repairs That Made a Difference

The feedback from visitors was enthusiastic: "Absolutely delighted!", "Really happy, thank you!", and "Great, I can wear these to a wedding next week. Thank you!" The wedding trousers were successfully altered by our textile team.

The textile station was busy all afternoon. Along with the wedding trousers, we repaired a jumpsuit and a coat cuff, with our volunteers using traditional tools like this wooden thread spool holder.

## Technology and Tools

The tech team upgraded a laptop from Windows to Ubuntu, extending its usable life indefinitely. An upgraded desktop computer was also installed in the Village Hall's Ringrose Room.

## Learning Moments

Not every repair succeeds. We attempted to revive a cuckoo clock - Gary listened carefully to diagnose the issue - but couldn't fix it.

Sometimes the diagnosis requires very close attention!

An Xbox controller had battery damage beyond repair, and several mobile phones from a deceased owner couldn't be wiped without passcodes - a reminder of the digital challenges with inherited devices.

## Next Event

Our next repair café is on **November 22nd, 1-3pm**. After that, we'll be taking a break over the winter months and will return in **February 2026**.

Check our website and social media for updates. Thank you to all volunteers and visitors who continue to make the Tregony Repair Café a success.
