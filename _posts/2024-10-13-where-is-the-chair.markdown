Yesterday morning, our chair/benevolent dictator Ian Hocking (that's me, talking about myself in the third person) made an appearance on [BBC Radio Cornwall](https://www.bbc.co.uk/radiocornwall) as the enigmatic 'chair' on [James Dundon](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/dundonradio)'s show, with [Matt Tancock](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/matt-tancock-019b29187) standing in as host (along with producer Lewis Webb).

Imagine being a piece of furniture on the radio! Listeners called in, attempting to decipher my location... To those who cracked the case: well done, you'd make fine detectives!

Thanks to Matt and Lewis for having me. It was great fun.

Missed out? Tune in to BBC Radio Cornwall.
