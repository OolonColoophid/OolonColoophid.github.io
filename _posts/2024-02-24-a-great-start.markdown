The Tregony Repair Café is well and truly underway. We opened our doors to welcome a parade of interesting items, the vast majority of which we were able to repair or significantly improve, increasing their useful lifetimes:

- **Vintage Record Deck**: Stylus arm not dropping, requiring delicate handling.
- **Ice Cream Machine**: Arrived with an unknown fault, ready for a diagnostic challenge.
- **Solar Lights**: Wire unattached, possibly needing a simple solder to bring back the light.
- **Duvet Cover & Trousers**: Fabric repairs needed, including a duvet cover tear and a trouser pocket repair.
- **Computer Printers**: Two printers, one not feeding properly, and another just needing general attention.
- **Dolls**: Seeking to reunite them with their missing limbs.
- **Vacuum Cleaners**: A "Henry" Hoover and a Dyson, both in need of some TLC to get back to cleaning.
- **Lamp**: With a stuck switch needing a fix to light up once more.
- **Clothing Repairs**: A jumper and another jumper for darning, keeping our textile experts busy.
- **Electronics Galore**: A speaker, a heater, a Samsung tablet, and laptops (one not switching on and another that just died), each with their unique challenges.
- **Seasonal Cheer**: An electric Christmas light set needing a fix to shine brightly once again.
- **Kitchen Gadget**: A liquidiser, asking for help to blend smoothly again.
