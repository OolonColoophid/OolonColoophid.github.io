Our October repair café at Tregony Village Hall brought together our dedicated volunteers to tackle everything from electrical repairs to delicate textile work. The afternoon session saw a wonderful mix of successful fixes, creative problem-solving, and that essential community spirit.

The electronics table was buzzing with activity. Mike and Paul successfully soldered Christmas lights back to working order - just in time for the festive season ahead! Mike also tackled a table lamp with a faulty switch, bringing it back to life with careful electrical work.

Brewing success: this coffee pot was restored to perfect working order.

Not every repair could succeed, though we always give it our best shot. A brush handle with shattered plastic proved beyond saving, and a phone charger had reached the end of its natural life.

Richard had a particularly successful afternoon, fixing a zip, getting a pasta roller mostly operational (good enough for perfect pasta!), and carefully repairing a computer key.

Magical mending: Jon worked on reattaching the arms of this charming fairy sculpture.

Jon took on a particularly delicate task - gluing the arms back onto a fairy sculpture. These careful repairs preserve both functionality and sentimental value.

Sometimes plastic shatters beyond repair - but we always try our best.

Sue's textile skills were in high demand, successfully repairing a cushion during the session. She also went home with an impressive homework list including trouser patches, jacket seam repairs, multiple hem adjustments for several people, and new zips for a school skirt and other items. The dedication of our volunteers extends well beyond the Saturday afternoon sessions!

Essential fuel: the refreshments table kept volunteers and visitors energised throughout the afternoon.

As always, our refreshment table provided the perfect accompaniment to an afternoon of community repair and conversation.

Our next repair café will be held on **Saturday, November 22nd, 1:00-3:00 PM** at Tregony Village Hall. Bring your broken items, share a cup of tea, and discover what our skilled volunteers can help you fix. No appointment needed - everyone welcome!
