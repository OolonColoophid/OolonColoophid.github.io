It was another fantastic repair café yesterday. We were delighted to welcome Nick Waitz and John from [Treverbyn Hall](https://www.thehall.org.uk), who brought their Really Useful Van to show their support and lend their expertise to our repair efforts. Thanks also to the [1st Roseland Scout Group](https://www.scouts.org.uk/groups/10023115?loc=plymouth&page=30&slug=1st-Roseland-Scout-Group) who did an amazing job running the Toy Swap table and providing toys. More thanks to [Tregony Social Club](https://www.facebook.com/p/Tregony-Sports-and-Social-Club-100063501941046/) for keeping everyone refreshed with tea, coffee, and hot chocolate throughout the morning. And not forgetting our wonderful volunteers who gave up their time to help out.

It was the busiest session of the year so far, with a diverse range of items brought in for repair. Here's a glimpse of what our volunteers tackled:

Some items, as usual, proved challenging.
