It was another fantastic repair café yesterday. We were delighted to welcome Nick Waitz and John from [Treverbyn Hall](https://www.thehall.org.uk), who brought their Really Useful Van to show their support and lend their expertise to our repair efforts. Thanks also to the [1st Roseland Scout Group](https://www.scouts.org.uk/groups/10023115?loc=plymouth&page=30&slug=1st-Roseland-Scout-Group) who did an amazing job running the Toy Swap table and providing toys. More thanks to [Tregony Social Club](https://www.facebook.com/p/Tregony-Sports-and-Social-Club-100063501941046/) for keeping everyone refreshed with tea, coffee, and hot chocolate throughout the morning. And not forgetting our wonderful volunteers who gave up their time to help out.
