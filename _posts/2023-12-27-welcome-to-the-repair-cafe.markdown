Greetings to all our Tregony neighbours and friends!

We are thrilled to launch the Tregony Repair Cafe's online hub, a place where our community's spirit of sustainability, skill-sharing, and camaraderie shines bright. This blog will serve as your go-to source for updates, stories, and insights from our Repair Cafe gatherings, where we come together to repair, recycle, and rejoice in the art of fixing things.

At the Tregony Repair Cafe, we believe that repairing is caring â€“ for our possessions, our planet, and our community. Each item we mend not only saves it from the landfill but also preserves the stories and memories attached to it. Whether it's a cherished heirloom, a daily-use appliance, or a beloved toy, we're here to breathe new life into your items with skill and love.

Join us on this wonderful journey of making do and mending. We invite you to share your experiences, tips, and stories with us. Let's create a tapestry of tales that celebrate the resilience, creativity, and warmth of our community.

Stay tuned for our upcoming cafe dates, repair success stories, volunteer spotlights, and much more. Together, let's build a future where sustainability is a shared goal.

Welcome aboard!
