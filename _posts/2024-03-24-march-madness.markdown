We had a fantastic caf√© on Saturday 23 March. We fixed our heaviest item so far, a tumble dryer! Lots of coffee was consumed, as well as a biscuits, and we're grateful to the Tregonians (and others from further afield) who braved the sometimes inclement weather. Onwards and upwards to the next one, 27th April 1-3pm.

This one is proving tricky to repair! It'll be a combination of physical repair and cleaning that sees it being used again, hopefully.
