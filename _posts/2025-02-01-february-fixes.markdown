We had a wonderful repair caf√© session on Saturday 1st February. From electrical repairs to furniture restoration, our volunteers tackled a diverse range of items. We're particularly proud of our successful furniture repairs and electrical fixes this month. Join us for our next session on March 22nd, 1-3pm!
