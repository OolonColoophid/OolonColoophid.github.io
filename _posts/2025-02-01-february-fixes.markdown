We had a wonderful repair caf√© session on Saturday 1st February. From electrical repairs to furniture restoration, our volunteers tackled a diverse range of items. We're particularly proud of our successful furniture repairs and electrical fixes this month. Join us for our next session on March 22nd, 1-3pm!

We look at many more items than are shown below. For some reason, we have more photos of things we couldn't repair than usual; but the overall repair rate remains about 80%.

We also made a successful repair of a doll's head using a wood-to-wood dowel connection, but couldn't repair a heated greenhouse propagator that proved impossible to open due to its glued construction.

See you next time, March 22nd, 1-3pm at the Tregony Village Hall!
