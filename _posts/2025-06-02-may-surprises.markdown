Our May repair cafe brought some delightful surprises to Tregony Village Hall, blending modern tech fixes with traditional sewing skills. From malware removal to textile repairs, our volunteers tackled an impressive variety of challenges during the bustling Saturday afternoon session.

Our textile specialists were kept particularly busy, successfully completing repairs on a child's dress, school blazer sleeve, and men's jeans.

The electronics table saw steady action too, with successful repairs including:
- DVD player restoration
- Strimmer maintenance and repair
- Lamp rewiring

Not every item could be saved, reminding us that some things reach the natural end of their useful life. A severely cracked plate and a toaster with multiple issues joined our "we tried" collection.

Several items went home as "homework projects" - including duvet covers needing zips and trousers requiring shortening. Our volunteers' dedication extends beyond the formal session hours, with many taking on projects that need quiet concentration at home.

The afternoon also featured our popular toy swap table, where families exchanged books and toys, proving that sharing resources is just as valuable as repairing them.

Community sharing: the toy and book swap table offered treasures for all ages.

Our next repair cafe will be held on **Saturday, June 28th, 1:00-3:00 PM** at Tregony Village Hall. Whether you need a quick fix, want to learn new skills, or simply enjoy the community atmosphere, everyone is welcome. No appointment necessary - just bring your broken items and we'll see what magic our volunteers can work!
