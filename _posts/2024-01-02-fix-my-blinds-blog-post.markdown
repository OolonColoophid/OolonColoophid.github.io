## Empower Yourself with DIY Blind Repairs

Greetings, Tregony Repair Cafe community! Today, we've come across a fantastic resource for DIY enthusiasts and repair aficionados: [Fix My Blinds](https://fixmyblinds.com).

### A Story of Empowerment

In 2000, Mike, an on-site blind repairman, recognized a common need: empowering people to repair their own blinds. This insight led to the creation of Fix My Blinds, a website offering over 3,000 parts and comprehensive repair resources.

### More Than Just Parts

Fix My Blinds stands out with its extensive library of instructional videos, written instructions, and part diagrams. They're committed to providing clear, honest product support and repair guides, making blind repair simple and accessible.

### Why It Matters

For our community in Cornwall, understanding and maintaining our living spaces is vital. Fix My Blinds aligns perfectly with our ethos at Tregony Repair Cafe: promoting sustainability and skill-sharing. Repairing blinds not only saves money but also extends the life of your items, reducing waste.
