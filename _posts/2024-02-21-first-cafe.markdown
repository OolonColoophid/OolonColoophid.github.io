We're looking forward to seeing you all at our first repair café this Saturday, from 1pm until 3pm. 

Our services this weekend include general repair (for things that need tightening, putting back together, and so on), electrical and computing repair, as well as textile/clothing repair.

Not to mention a nice cup of tea or coffee! 

Donations are appreciated but not required.

See you then!
