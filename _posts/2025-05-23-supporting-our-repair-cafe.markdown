We're thrilled to announce that we now have an easy way for our community to support the Tregony Repair Café through donations! While our repair café has always operated on a "pay what you can" basis, donations help us keep this wonderful community initiative running and growing.

## How Your Support Helps

Every donation, no matter the size, directly supports our mission to repair, reuse, and reduce waste in our community. Your contributions help us:

- **Keep our doors open**: Cover hall rental, refreshments, and ongoing operational costs
- **Maintain and expand our toolkit**: Purchase new tools and replacement parts for repairs
- **Support our volunteers**: Provide training resources and materials for our dedicated repair team
- **Grow our impact**: Reach more people and save even more items from landfill

## Easy Donation with PayPal

We've made it incredibly simple to donate using your smartphone. Just scan our PayPal QR code and you can make a secure donation in seconds:

## Suggested Donation: £5 per Repair

While no one is ever turned away for lack of funds, we suggest a donation of **£5 per repair** to help cover our costs and ensure we can continue serving our community. Whether you donate £1 or £50, every contribution makes a real difference.

## Visit Our New Donation Page

For more information about how donations help and alternative ways to contribute, visit our new [Donate Now](/donate/) page. There you'll find details about our mission, how funds are used, and additional ways to support the café.

## Thank You to Our Community

The Tregony Repair Café exists because of our amazing community. Every repair we complete, every skill we share, and every connection we make happens because people like you believe in reducing waste and supporting each other.

Whether you donate, volunteer, bring items for repair, or simply spread the word about what we do, you're helping create a more sustainable and connected community.

## Join Us at Our Next Café

Remember, our next repair café is Saturday, May 24th from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM at Tregony Village Hall. Bring your broken items, enjoy some refreshments, and be part of our wonderful community of fixers and learners!

Together, we're making a difference—one repair, one donation, and one connection at a time.
