We're always learning from both our successes and challenges. Each repair café adds to our collective knowledge and helps us better serve our community in the future.

Join us for our next repair café on Saturday, May 24th from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM at Tregony Village Hall. Remember to bring your broken items for a new lease on life, and enjoy a cup of tea or coffee while you wait!
