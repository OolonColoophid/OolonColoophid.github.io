Our April repair café, held on the 27th at the Village Hall, was another testament to the power of community and the dedication of our volunteer repairers (not to mention those helping wrangle and make tea and coffee!). We extend our sincere thanks to all who participated, braving the northerly wind to bring in their items for repair.

Our skilled volunteers always thoroughly examine each item to determine the best course of action, even when a repair may not be possible. This one, unfortunately, had something niggly happening inside the motor itself.

Our volunteers breathe new life into worn furniture, ensuring each piece is ready for continued use. In this case, new life was instilled via a hammer and plenty of elbow grease!

![Clock examined by our skilled volunteers](/assets/aprilShowers/clock_investigated.jpeg){:.lead width="800" height="600" loading="lazy"}
Our volunteers are skilled in various areas but alas not the intricacies of clockwork. This one was slowing down, probably because of some dust or dirt in the mechanism. If you know anyone who repairs clocks, please let us know!

Our tech-savvy volunteers are equipped to examine and troubleshoot a variety of modern devices, including iPads. A thorough look at this one didn't reveal exactly what was going wrong with it, but we helped the bringer discover more about its settings.
