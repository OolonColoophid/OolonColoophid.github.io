Our March repair café at Tregony Village Hall on Saturday 22nd was another busy success! We had a wonderful mix of repairs from bike maintenance to clothing alterations and electronics troubleshooting. Our volunteers were kept busy throughout the session.

Our volunteers also successfully repaired:
- An owl picture frame
- A teepee pole
- Multiple bike adjustments (seats, handlebars, chains)
- Clothing items including new buttons, mended knees, shortened hems, and replaced zips
- A rucksack needing a new zip
- A leather belt with new holes
- A cassette player with a previously rusty capstan
- A table lamp with a loose top

Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we couldn't repair a Dyson vacuum cleaner with charging issues, a CD player with internal damage, and a record player that needs a professional cleaning before further diagnosis.

It's always rewarding to extend the life of items that would otherwise be discarded. Each repair represents resources saved and skills shared within our community.

Join us for our next repair café on Saturday, April 26th from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM at Tregony Village Hall. Remember to bring items that need fixing, and feel free to stay for a cuppa while you wait!
