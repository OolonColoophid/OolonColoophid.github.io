Sometimes our repair café encounters items that need specialist tools or expertise beyond what we can offer in a Saturday afternoon session. We've discovered [We Are Repairs](https://wearerepairs.com), a useful UK-wide directory that helps people find trusted local repair businesses.

## Finding Professional Help

When large furniture pieces, vintage electronics, or delicate items need more time than our café sessions allow, this free directory lets people search by item type or location to find independent repairers across the UK.

## Supporting Our Local Repair Community

We're particularly interested in celebrating the skilled repairers in our area. If any of our volunteers run repair businesses, or if you know quality local repairers who deserve recognition, We Are Repairs offers them a platform to connect with customers who value craftsmanship and sustainability.

It's about strengthening the entire repair ecosystem - from our community café sessions to professional services that keep precious items in use rather than heading to landfill.

When we can fix something on the spot at our monthly sessions, wonderful! When something needs specialist attention, it's good to have trusted local professionals to recommend.
