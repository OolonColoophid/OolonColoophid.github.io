June's repair café at Tregony Village Hall was a wonderful showcase of community spirit and practical problem-solving. From vintage tea caddies to modern solar lights, our volunteers tackled an impressive variety of repairs during the busy Saturday afternoon session.

## Successful Repairs

Our volunteers were kept busy with a diverse range of successful fixes. We worked our magic on a beautiful tea caddy, restoring its clasp to working order.

## Textile Triumphs

Our sewing specialists had another successful day with fabric repairs. A cushion zip was expertly rejoined and stitched, giving new life to a well-loved piece.

Other textile victories included a boiler suit receiving a new zip and general repairs, trouser hems being restitched, and jogging shorts getting pocket reinforcement for extended wear.

Several other items were looked at: a blanket box had its split lid repaired, a candle box received complete renovation with splits fixed and a new leather hinge installed, and a stainless steel drawer set had its broken runner fixed with careful pliers work.

## Maritime Success

One of our more unusual repairs was a sailing boat whose mast received expert attention.

## Challenges Faced

Not every item could be saved, reminding us that some repairs are beyond even our skilled volunteers' capabilities. A toaster proved too challenging to fix completely.

Some battles are harder to win - this toaster's problems proved too complex for repair.

An air fryer's timer couldn't be repaired, and a tricycle's broken ball bearing was beyond our workshop's scope.

Our toy swap table was particularly popular this month, with DVDs now joining the usual selection of books and toys for families to exchange.

Perhaps our most charming visitor was Jackson, who attended the café in perfect condition and needed absolutely no repairs.
