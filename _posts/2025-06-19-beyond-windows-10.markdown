As we approach October 2025, millions of perfectly functional computers will face an artificial expiration date when Microsoft ends support for Windows 10. Rather than rushing to buy new hardware, there's a sustainable alternative that aligns perfectly with our repair café philosophy: breathe new life into your existing computer.

The [End of 10 initiative](https://endof10.org) champions a simple but powerful message - production of a computer accounts for 75% of its lifetime carbon emissions. Keeping your functioning device longer is one of the most effective ways to reduce your environmental impact while saving money.

Success story: this older laptop got a new lease on life with Linux, proving that functional computers don't need to be discarded.

Linux operating systems offer a free, secure, and often faster alternative to Windows, transforming older computers into reliable machines that can serve you for years to come. These open-source systems grant you complete control over your computer while respecting your privacy and providing excellent performance on older hardware.

But making the transition doesn't have to be daunting or done alone. This is where community support becomes invaluable - and where our repair café can help.

At Tregony Repair Café, we understand that technology repairs aren't just about fixing broken screens or replacing batteries. Sometimes the best "repair" is helping someone transition from an artificially obsolete system to one that will serve them well into the future. Our volunteers have experience with various operating systems and can provide guidance on making your computer work better for longer.

Whether you need help backing up important files before making the switch, guidance on choosing the right Linux distribution for your needs, or simply want to explore your options over a cup of coffee, we're here to support our community through these technological transitions.

Don't let corporate upgrade cycles force you into unnecessary purchases. Your computer isn't broken just because Microsoft says it's unsupported. With the right knowledge and community support, it can continue serving you reliably for years to come.

Visit [endof10.org](https://endof10.org) to learn more about this important initiative, and remember that our repair café volunteers are always happy to help with technology questions and transitions.

Our next repair café will be held on **Saturday, June 28th, 1:00-3:00 PM** at Tregony Village Hall. Check our [full schedule](/cafeTimes/) for all upcoming dates. Bring your tech questions along with any items needing repair - sustainable solutions are always worth exploring together!
