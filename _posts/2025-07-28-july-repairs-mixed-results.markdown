Our July repair café on Saturday 26th brought another wonderful afternoon of community problem-solving to Tregony Village Hall. From picture frames to power tools, our dedicated volunteers tackled a diverse range of repairs with their usual enthusiasm and expertise, all while serving up tea, coffee and biscuits.

## Successful Repairs

The session started strong with a beautiful oval picture frame that had been broken into four pieces. Through careful gluing and reassembly, our volunteers brought this treasured item back to its former glory.

A yard broom received new life when our team successfully refixed its head to the stake, making it ready for garden work once again.

One of our more unusual visitors was a homemade all-terrain vehicle model whose wheels needed attention. Our volunteers rose to the challenge and got it rolling smoothly again.

A delicate mini treasure box needed only a simple clasp repair to restore its functionality, proving that sometimes the smallest fixes make the biggest difference.

## Textile Triumphs

Our sewing specialists had been particularly busy with homework assignments completed before the session, including three pairs of trousers shortened, two zip repairs on trousers, one pair of shorts with a new zip, and two tops with various alterations.

During the live session, our textile team tackled specialized alterations including making stoma bag guards smaller, working on a lace dress to turn up the lining and remove sleeve frills, and restitching a belt to extend its useful life.

## Challenges Faced

Not every repair attempt meets with success, and July brought some particularly challenging items. A clock whose chime wouldn't stop proved beyond our general repair skills, requiring specialist clockwork expertise that we couldn't provide.

Time stood still for this repair - the perpetual chiming issue requires specialist clock expertise.

A drill with suspected solid-state chip errors couldn't be revived, demonstrating how modern electronics sometimes reach the end of their repairable life.

Modern challenges - this drill's chip errors proved beyond our repair capabilities.

Similarly, a vacuum cleaner with an extremely loud motor couldn't be helped, as it wasn't designed to be opened for service.

Some modern appliances resist repair - this vacuum's sealed design prevented any intervention.

These challenges remind us that while our volunteers are skilled and enthusiastic, some repairs require specialist knowledge or simply aren't economically viable with modern appliance design.

Whether you need a quick fix, want to learn new skills, or simply enjoy the community atmosphere, everyone is welcome.
