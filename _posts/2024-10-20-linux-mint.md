As you may have heard, Microsoft's Windows 10 reached its [End of Support (EOS) on October 14, 2024](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/end-of-support). This means that Microsoft is no longer providing security updates or technical support for Windows 10 devices. Many users might consider their older computers obsolete and dispose of them, potentially contributing to the growing problem of electronic waste in landfills. This not only harms the environment but also wastes perfectly functional hardware that could still serve a purpose with the right software.

## What does this mean for you?

If you're still using Windows 10, you might be wondering about your options. While upgrading to Windows 11 is one possibility, it's not the only solution. At our repair café, we're excited to offer an alternative that could breathe new life into your computer: Linux.

By considering alternatives like Linux, we can extend the life of these devices, reduce e-waste, and make a positive impact on our environment. Let's explore how we can keep your computer running smoothly and sustainably.

## Introducing Linux: A Free and Open-Source Alternative

[Linux](https://www.linux.org/) is a free, open-source operating system that can run on a wide variety of hardware, including older computers that might struggle with the latest version of Windows. It's known for its stability, security, and customizability.

## Why Consider Linux?

1. **Cost-effective**: Linux is free to download and use.
2. **Security**: Linux is less vulnerable to viruses and malware.
3. **Performance**: It can run smoothly on older hardware.
4. **Variety**: There are many user-friendly distributions to choose from.

## We're Here to Help

At our repair café, we're happy to assist you in transitioning to Linux (or, if you prefer, running Windows and Linux side by side). We recommend [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) for most users due to its user-friendly interface and similarity to Windows. However, we can also help with other lightweight distributions that might better suit your needs.

Our volunteers can guide you through:
- Backing up your important data
- Installing Linux on your computer
- Basic usage and finding alternatives to your familiar software

Now that the Windows 10 EOS has passed, it's crucial to consider your options. Visit us at the repair café, and we'll help you explore the best solution for your computing needs.

Remember, your old computer doesn't have to become e-waste – it might just need a new operating system to give it a second life!
