We're back after our summer break! Despite the absence of three of our valuable repairers (like Arnie, they'll be back), we had a busy café full of the usual random items, most of which we could fix---alas, we can't always fix things, but we always have a go. Here is a small selection of items brought in.

![The Cafe From the Stage](/assets/septRepairs/cafe_from_stage.jpeg){:.lead width="800" height="600" loading="lazy"}
The Village Hall has recently gone through an upgrade---solar panels, a new heating system---and is looking tip-top, the perfect venue!

![A Fixed Camera](/assets/septRepairs/camera_fixed.jpeg){:.lead width="800" height="600" loading="lazy"}
This film camera is actually tiny, but comes with its own zoom lens and is working perfectly. At least, it *was* working perfectly until its film-winding lever broke. Now it's fixed and can take pictures again!

![A Fixed Chair](/assets/septRepairs/chair.jpeg){:.lead width="800" height="600" loading="lazy"}
This chair has been de-wonkified by one of our repairers, Gary.

![Coffee Machine Not Repaired](/assets/septRepairs/coffee_machine.jpeg){:.lead width="800" height="600" loading="lazy"}
This coffee machine had a problem transferring power, and unfortunately we weren't able to fix it.

![Hair Curlers Being Repaired](/assets/septRepairs/hair_curlers.jpeg){:.lead width="800" height="600" loading="lazy"}
These hair curlers had a surprising amount of electronics inside. Fixed!
{:.figcaption}

![Heated Blanket Repaired](/assets/septRepairs/heated_blanket.jpeg){:.lead width="800" height="600" loading="lazy"}
A dodgy switch on this one wasn't transferring current to the blanket. Fixed too!
{:.figcaption}

![Nintendo](/assets/septRepairs/nintendo.jpeg){:.lead width="800" height="600" loading="lazy"}
This Nintendo Switch controller had a problem with its battery.
{:.figcaption}

![Sheriff Painting](/assets/septRepairs/sheriff_painting.jpeg){:.lead width="800" height="600" loading="lazy"}
This painting's subject is dressed in his official Sheriff regalia.
{:.figcaption}

![Sheriff Painting Reverse](/assets/septRepairs/sheriff_reverse.jpeg){:.lead width="800" height="600" loading="lazy"}
The sheriff's picture frame was broken; but here is some information placed within the frame. It reads: "ARTIST. - JOSEPH. EOWARD. HENNAH. THE GRIVE COTTAGE. MALPAS. NEWPORT. MON. COL JOHN EVANS. DSO. TD. DL. JP. HON COLONEL. 2NP BATT. THE MONMOUTHS HIRE. REG.T. HIGH SHERIFF OF MONMOUTHSHiRE. 1931 - 2."

![Picture Frame Being Repaired](/assets/septRepairs/frame_repair.jpeg){:.lead width="800" height="600" loading="lazy"}
Fixing the frame involved re-setting the inner frame, which had been added to cover the border of the painting, where some paint was missing.
{:.figcaption}

![Tray Reverse](/assets/septRepairs/tray_reverse.jpeg){:.lead width="800" height="600" loading="lazy"}
While repairing a tray with glass top, we came across this message from the previous glazier, a man called C A Coulson from Thanet, Kent, who re-glazed the tray in 1987. 
{:.figcaption}

![Vacuum Cleaner](/assets/septRepairs/vacuum_cleaner.jpeg){:.lead width="800" height="600" loading="lazy"}
This vacuum cleaner proved to be a tricky customer.
{:.figcaption}

![VCR Repair](/assets/septRepairs/vcr.jpeg){:.lead width="800" height="600" loading="lazy"}
Another tricky customer, this Video Cassette Recorder. Photo taken just before ejecting the cassette.

Do come along to our next repair café on 26th October, 2024, in the Tregony Village Hall.
