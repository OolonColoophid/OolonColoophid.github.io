Welcome to the Tregony Repair Café, a community-driven initiative nestled in the heart of Tregony, where we breathe new life into well-loved items. Our café is more than just a place for repairs; it's a vibrant hub of sharing, learning, and sustainability.

Join us in our journey to reduce waste, share invaluable skills, and strengthen our community bonds, one repair at a time. Whether you're here to fix a cherished possession, to learn repair skills, or simply to enjoy the camaraderie over a cup of tea, you're in the right place.

Together, let's cherish the stories behind our belongings and contribute to a more sustainable world. We can't wait to welcome you!
