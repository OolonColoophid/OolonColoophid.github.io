Has the zip gone in your coat? Has your toaster seen better days? Is your favourite chair getting wobbly? Don't throw it away! If you can bring it in, we can see what we can do!

A Repair Café is a community gathering where people bring broken items and learn how to fix them with the help of volunteers. We try to repair things like:

- clothes
- furniture
- electrical appliances
- bicycles
- crockery
- toys

At the Tregony Repair Café, you can bring your items in need of repair and collaborate with volunteers to fix them while enjoying a cup of coffee or tea.

Join us in our journey to reduce waste, share invaluable skills, and strengthen our community bonds, one repair at a time. Whether you're here to fix a cherished possession, to learn repair skills, or simply to enjoy the camaraderie over a cup of tea, you're in the right place.

Together, let's cherish the stories behind our belongings and contribute to a more sustainable world. We can't wait to welcome you!
