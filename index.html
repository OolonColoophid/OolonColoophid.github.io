        <h2>What's All This?</h2>
        <p>Has the zip gone in your coat? Has your toaster seen better days? Is your favourite chair getting wobbly? Don't throw it away! If you can bring it in, we can see what we can do!</p>
	<p>A Repair Café is a community gathering where people bring broken items and learn how to fix them with the help of volunteers. We try to repair things like:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>clothes</li>
		<li>furniture</li>
		<li>electrical appliances</li>
		<li>bicycles</li>
		<li>crockery</li>
		<li>toys</li>
	</ul>
	<p>At the Tregony Repair Café, you can bring your items in need of repair and collaborate with volunteers to fix them while enjoying a cup of coffee or tea.</p>
