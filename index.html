        <h2>What is a Repair Café?</h2>
        <p>A Repair Café is a community gathering where people bring broken items and learn how to fix them with the help of volunteers. It's about repairing things (like clothes, furniture, electrical appliances, bicycles, crockery, appliances, toys, etc.) to reduce waste, share skills, and strengthen community bonds. At the Tregony Repair Café, you can bring your items in need of repair and collaborate with volunteers to fix them while enjoying a cup of coffee or tea.</p>
